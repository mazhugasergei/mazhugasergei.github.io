				<Paragraph>
					I attended a 2D/3D animation and video production studio at Far Eastern Federal University (FEFU), where the
					advertising department requested I create a website for the university's upcoming Open Day event. The
					website's purpose was to engage prospective students, provide essential event details, and showcase FEFUâ€™s
					facilities and programs.
