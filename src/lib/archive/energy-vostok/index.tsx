				<p>Energy Vostok is one of the Molotov Group's companies. And they needed a front-end developer.</p>

					My first task was to add search functionality with a searchbar somewhere in the header on Vostok Energy
					website. I just need a place to put it. Thankfully soon enough I found out I can do whatever I like with the

				<p>Alright, now I just can put search icon in the header and open a dialog when a user clicks it.</p>

			<Section id="search" title="Search">
				<p>
					Then I added a search dialog. The search results are categories that look like wide blocks and the products
					list. When a user clicks on a category search result, it opens the category page with the list of products in
					it and filters. Clicking on a product opens the product page with its details. And pressing enter or clicking
					the search button right after the input opens the search results page.
